# 10x Product Market Research

## Background
This 10x engagement explored the impact of various attempts to create an improved online experience when conducting market research for buying new software. This concept has a long history, but the current thinking can be traced back to 2009 when apps.gov intended to become the central catalog for showcasing modern cloud apps and making it easy for staff to deploy. The concept was innovative, but its impact has been limited.

Instead of proposing another iteration of a similar concept, in this 10x engagement we reviewed previous work to glean what lessons could be learned. We also incorporated new research to establish a baseline for what it will take for a government-wide market research destination to be successful.

## Resources

Instead of replicating what others have attempted, we decided to do a survey of prior projects and interview TTS staff that worked projected related to apps.gov, Schedule 70, and cloud service contracting to understand why TTS has worked on so many similar projects. In addition, we created a catalog of each of those projects and supplementary information.

*Previous iterations of apps.gov*

### Version 1—2009

- The first version of apps.gov was tasked with launching in 120 days without a clear strategy, value proposition, or long-term governance.

- It was built using information that was in GSA Advantage (you can find an [archived snapshot of the home page on archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20101121125706/https://www.apps.gov/cloud/advantage/main/start_page.do)), but that data was not well-structured for creating a catalog of cloud services and was not user-friendly.

- One lasting success for this version of apps.gov was that the program was able to negotiate government-friendly terms of services for free cloud-based services such as Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr. Later on, this work moved over to digital.gov ([and can still be found on the website](https://digital.gov/resources/negotiated-terms-of-service-agreements/)). However, the team noted that because there was no plan or budget to maintain this information, much of what is on digital.gov is outdated. Even though there is an active community of practice maintaining the work, there is nobody proactively ensuring that the negotiated terms of service are current.

### Version 2—PIFs

- This is the current live version of apps.gov and was developed by a team of Presidential Innovation Fellows.

- The focus was on simplifying the vendor’s process for submitting information into the catalog.

	- Vendors could submit their information using pull requests on the public GitHub repository.

- This initiative did not solve for what government purchasers needed
The content model included a lot of extraneous information that would not be useful to program or contracting officers (include AngelList profiles for startups).

- Provided high-level information but very little information on how to procure software. Visitors were only given information that its software had been approved somewhere, but not how to get it for their office.
- No long-term governance plan.
	- All work stopped on this project after the team left.
	- While vendors can still make pull requests, nobody is spreading its adoption within the government or maintaining the information.

### Version 3—Cloud Marketplace

Version 3 of apps.gov was never completed. It was a project backed by the White House Office of American Innovation.
It was a set of prototypes in Invision that focused on designing a new buying process for the government.

The 18F team that worked on the project designed it as a proof of concept to try to encourage OAI to push for contracting policy changes that would make it easier for government to acquire cloud services, but no resources were put into making those changes.

**Plain Language Schedule 70**

The Plain Language Schedule 70 was an early 18F project with GSA to create a plain language guide for helping vendors navigate the process for getting Schedule 70 approval.

**Project Boise**

Project Boise was a previous 18F research project focused on the ATO process for compliance and management for software as a service product. The hope was to create processes that could automate the ATO process.
